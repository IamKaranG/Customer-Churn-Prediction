# Business problem is very simple, 
# There is a Bank who wants to
# retain their existing customers who may churn, for that they have to
# know which existing customers has the highest probability of
# leaving the company and which customers have lowest probability
# of leaving the company.
# Churning of customers is a big problem for banks, they want to
# maximise the retention of the customers so that they can plan their
# future projects.
# Also if a Bank wants to get a funding from big investors, Rate of
# churning plays an important role.
# So Bank wants to build a Machine Learning model which can
# predict whether a particular customer will churn or not. 


## DATA ##
# We have 10000 rows with 13 features and 1 target variable, Every
# row tells us different customer details and whether they have
# churned or not.

## OBSERVATION:
# here 0 means => customers who stayed(not churned), 1 means => customers who left(churned)
# here we can see that in center of plot a circle is forming consiting of people who have churned in maximum number

# so it means that people with age less than 35 and more than 55 more likely to stay with bank

# here there is difference between the values of mean and median in balace, which means there are some outliers present 
## Now we will do the following 
# combining the numerical and categorical data
# splitting the data into training and testing
# training the models
# testing for the performance
# conclusion
# now combining both numerical and categorical data
# it it basically a horizontal join
# before that we will be removing the Exited column from the categorical dataframe as it is already in numerical and we don't want duplicates
